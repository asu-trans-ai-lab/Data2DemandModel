This open-source code Data2DemandModel: aims to demonstrate how to integrate
deep learning methods with the standard 4-step process in transportation
modeling, using a Computational Graph-based approach with multiple data sources.

\#What is GMNS? General Travel Network Format Specification is a product of
Zephyr Foundation, which aims to advance the field through flexible and
efficient support, education, guidance, encouragement, and incubation. Further
Details in https://zephyrtransport.org/projects/2-network-standard-and-tools/
The underlying network uses GMNS format.

\#How to start

2.  https://github.com/xzhou99/TCGLite/tree/master/src One can start working on
    a simple example using the hypothetic Sinoux Fall network, and then
    visualize the network and estimation result in NeXTA:
