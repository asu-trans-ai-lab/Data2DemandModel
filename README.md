This open-source python package Data2DemandModel aims to demonstrate how to
integrate deep learning methods with the standard 4-step process in
transportation modeling, using a Computational Graph-based approach with
multiple data sources.

This source code is forked from the original contribution by Dr. Xin (Bruce) Wu
at Arizona State University (<https://github.com/Grieverwzn>).

\#What is GMNS? General Travel Network Format Specification is a product of
Zephyr Foundation, which aims to advance the field through flexible and
efficient support, education, guidance, encouragement, and incubation. Further
Details in https://zephyrtransport.org/projects/2-network-standard-and-tools/
The underlying network uses GMNS format.
